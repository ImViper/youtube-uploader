Route order fix needed:

Current problematic order:
1. GET /accounts
2. GET /accounts/:id  <-- This catches everything including /accounts/stats
3. GET /accounts/stats  <-- Never reached
4. GET /accounts/export  <-- Never reached

Correct order should be:
1. GET /accounts
2. GET /accounts/stats  <-- Specific routes first
3. GET /accounts/export  <-- Specific routes first
4. GET /accounts/:id  <-- Catch-all route last

This is a common Express routing issue where parameterized routes catch specific routes if they come first.
